The CTF cluster-level score is computed via simple averaging of the indicators within each cluster. This cluster-level score captures the overall performance for a given institutional category relative to the “global frontier.” The drawback of this robust methodological aggregation decision is that the data requirement is higher. Several families in both the static and dynamic versions do not meet the data requirements for meaningful aggregation (i.e., the balanced sample is too small or empty), and thus CTF cluster scores are not computed."
